# GMEXT-AdMob
Repository for GameMaker's AdMob Extension

This repository was created with the intent of presenting users with the latest version available of the extension (even previous to marketplace updates) and also provide a way for the community to contribute with bug fixes and feature implementation.

This extension will work both with Android and iOS platform exports. However note that iOS version will require [installing CocoaPods](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008958858-iOS-and-tvOS-Using-CocoaPods) in your system (*on later versions of the IDE installing cocoapods is no longer necessary*)
